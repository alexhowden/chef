# chef

Chef is a simple GUI app built with tkinter to help students learn and practice multiplication.

Currently supports 3 digit times 2 digit, 4 digit times 2 digit, 3 digit times 3 digit, and 4 digit times 3 digit problems.

Checks work after each row to more easily identify mistakes.

Designed to help practice the basics, beyond that I would recommend solving problems on paper for mastery.

Credits are awarded for solving problems correctly, to be redeemed for various things.
